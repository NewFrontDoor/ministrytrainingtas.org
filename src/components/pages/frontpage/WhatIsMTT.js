            <h3 className="darkBlueHeader">Ministry Training Tasmania is a state-wide movement that seeks to grow and equip a new generation of gospel workers for Tasmania, Australia and the world. Our hands-on ministry training program will give you a fantastic chance to test your suitability for ongoing full-time Christian leadership. </h3>

            <h2 className="aquaHeader">Authentic training in a vibrant ministry</h2>
            <p>We offer practical ministry training among uni students at the University of Tasmania. This provides unique opportunities to engage with different philosophies; experience a whole range of events, programs and activities; and invest in young Christians and emerging leaders. As a trainee, you will learn in relationship with a godly and experienced ministry trainer who will teach you skills and help you grow in character and conviction.</p>

            <h2 className="aquaHeader">Tasmania’s natural advantage</h2>
            <p>Training in Tasmania is also a unique opportunity. Ministry in a regional city is more integrated and holistic than it can be in larger cities. Rather than spending a lot of time on public transport or working in a single ministry silo, it is possible to enjoy rich interdependence and collaboration with different churches and parachurches across the city and the State. On top of all of this is Tasmania’s beautiful natural environment and vibrant cultural life.</p>
